Bridges enable mobility and commerce throughout the region. Federal transportation legislation requires state departments of transportation to use a Lowest Life Cycle Cost (LLCC) approach to maximize the life of a bridge at the lowest cost. LLCC emphasizes preservation and promotes the right treatment at the right time, while incorporating risk into the analysis. Bridges with a poor condition rating indicate maintenance needs that do not pose safety issues, as long as they are resolved in a timely manner.

This indicator reflects the _Connections 2050_ Plan goal to rebuild and modernize the regionâ€™s transportation assets in order to achieve and maintain a state-of-good repair.
