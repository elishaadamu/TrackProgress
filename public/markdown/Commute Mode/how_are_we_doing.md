From 2006 to 2023, both commuters *living* and *working* in the region have overall increasingly used alternative options relative to driving alone to work—the non-single occupant vehicle (SOV) commute share has increased by 10.8%, as seen in the first and second charts. The region had been on a slight upward trend for non-SOV use through 2019. The Covid pandemic brought about an unprecedented 11% decrease in drive alone commutes, while working from home shot up by 18% and public transit commutes dropped by nearly 5%. In 2022, there was about a 3% increase in drive alone commutes, with an even greater decrease in working from home as other non-SOV modes gained, particularly public transit, carpooling, and walking. 2023 saw a slight increase in SOV commutes, another decline in working from home, and continued growth in public transit, carpooling, and walking commutes.

In the region’s *urban areas* (UAs), from 2009 to 2023, the percentage of commuters using means other than driving alone increased by nearly 9% in the Philadelphia UA, and about 11% in the Trenton urban area (shown in the third chart). However, the percentage of commuters using public transit declined by nearly 3% in the Philadelphia UA, and about 1% in the Trenton UA over that time period. There was a 14% rise in working from home in both UAs over that timeframe which has driven the increases in non-SOV travel.
